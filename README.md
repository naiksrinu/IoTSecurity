# List of IoT External Interfaces

- `WiFi:` A popular wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices on the same network.

- `Bluetooth:` A short-range wireless communication technology used for connecting devices in a personal area network (PAN).

- `Zigbee:` A low-power wireless communication protocol designed for IoT applications that require long battery life and reliable data transmission.

- `LoRaWAN:` A Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) protocol designed for long-range communication between IoT devices and the cloud.

- `Sigfox:` Another LPWAN protocol designed for low-power devices that require long-range communication.

- `NFC:` A short-range wireless communication technology used for contactless data exchange between two devices.

- `MQTT:` A lightweight messaging protocol that is commonly used in IoT applications for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.

- `CoAP:` A protocol designed for constrained networks and devices to enable RESTful communication with the internet.

- `REST APIs:` Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are commonly used in IoT applications to enable communication between devices and web services.

- `Modbus:` A serial communication protocol commonly used for industrial automation and control systems.

- `GSM:` A cellular network standard that enables mobile communication between devices over the airwaves.
